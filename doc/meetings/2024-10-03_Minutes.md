# Action points

## Approve workshop materials

### Discussion

-   Suggestions about changes to slides may be confusing (for DMC), and there is
    little time now.

-   Instead of changing the "minimal script" directly, KBN may paste suggestions
    of changes in the chat, for the participants to copy-paste into their script
    if they want.

-   Giving them alternatives of edits to the script can be helpful for giving
    them freedom to make changes and gain confidence.

-   Sign-up form: Own ID in Slack may be unkown, better express it as "name in
    Slack" and make it non-required.

### Agreements

-   **Approved**: Accept latest version of slides & script

-   **Approved**: Sign-up form (after changing "Slack ID" to "name", and making
    it non-required)

### Tasks

-   **DMC**: Merge changes, update shortened links and render final version
    [ASAP]

-   **DMC**: Change "Slack ID" to "Slack name" (and make it non-required) in the
    sign-up form [ASAP]

-   **KBN**: Collect [syntax
    examples](https://github.com/DaniMori/sortee-git-workshop/blob/164acbc03f05f9739e6b73b6bafd89a54aeeb7f9/src/Analysis.R#L58-L75)
    to share [10-14]

## Discuss coordination

### Discussion

-   No need for extra help during workshop (but maybe unclear)

### Agreements

-   **Approved**: Provide technical assistance in Slack channel in previous
    weeks (DMC, and KBN if available in active hours to cover time zone).

-   **Approved**: Request two breakup rooms (one additional for "backup").

-   **Rejected**:

### Tasks

-   **DMC**: Respond to committee's email [ASAP]

-   **DMC**: Send "participant version" of slides to the conference OSF [ASAP]

    [10-14]

-   **KBN**: Download from OSF & test "participant slides"" [10-14]

## Assign tasks and responsibilities during workshop

### Discussion

-   Chat moderation can be done in chat or live; it may depend on the question,
    time left, etc.

-   Double quotes are formatted as typographic when pasting to Zomm chat, it may
    be an issue in the R console (but not in the terminal, we tested it)

    -   "code fending" (e.g. \`\`\`) may solve the issue

### Agreements

-   **Approved**: DMC to act as main presenter

-   **Approved**: KBN to provide technical assistance, moderate chat, keep time,
    provide extra info on chat (links, commands, syntax edit suggests), &
    comment or intervene as he feels convenient.

-   **Approved**: KBN to decide how to address questions (live, on chat...) at
    his own criterion

# Suggestions, questions

## Advetising sign-up form

### Tasks

-   **DMC**: Ask committee how to advertise the sign-up form (which Slack
    channel), or whether they can do it [ASAP]

## Zoom setup

### Discussion

-   How the committee will manage it is described in the [Guide for interactive
    event
    facilitators](https://unedo365-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/dvmorillo_psi_uned_es/Documents/Documentaci%C3%B3n/SORTEE/2024%20Guide%20for%20SORTEE%20interactive%20event%20facilitators.docx?d=w7508c750465b4ed9bf4249f8f81af5c0&csf=1&web=1&e=Zm84D2)
