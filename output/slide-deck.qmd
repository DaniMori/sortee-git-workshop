## What is git?

<br>

-   Version control system

<br>

-   "History" of changes

<br>

-   Allows "time-travelling"

## What is Github?

<br>

-   Centralized git server

<br>

-   Backup + collaboration

<br>

-   Nice GUI & features on top of VC

## Typical VC setup

::: notes
-   You have a "local repository"

-   You don't need a "cloud server" to use version control

-   You use a VC server to back-up and collaborate

## Git jargon

<br>

-   **Repository ("repo")**: A "project", where all your files live

-   **Remote**: Copy of a repository in Github

-   **Local**: Copy of a repository in your computer

-   **Clone**: To copy a local repository from a remote

## Create a repository (I)

1.  [Sign in](https://github.com/login) to your GitHub account

<br>

2.  Go to <https://github.com/DaniMori/rproj-template>

<br>

3.  Click on "Use this template"

<br>

4.  Click on "Create a new repository"

## Create a repository (and II)

::: nonincremental
5.  Fill in "Repository name" and "Description" with:

    > **Repository name:** my-first-repo\
    > **Description:** My first repository ever in GitHub

    OR

    use ***a project name and description of your choice***
:::

6.  Choose "Private" visibility

7.  Leave "Include all branches" deselected

8.  Click on "Create repository from template"

::: notes
Depending on your settings you may be required a 2-factor authentication method

(NEXT)

The template will add some useful pre-cooked features to the new repository

(NEXT)

(NEXT)

(NEXT)

The name must be something short, and representatitve of the project aim

Description must be "short" and direct

(NEXT)

Public: Anyone can see it, even without signing in to GitHub

Private: Only collaborators (we will add them later on)

(NEXT)

We only need the current state of the repository (what is in the last "version"
of the main branch)

(NEXT)
:::

## Explore your brand new repo {.nonincremental}

::: nonincremental
<br>

-   Check interface elements: tabs, branches, files, "About", "README.md"

<br>

-   Check "Repository structure" section in "README.md"

<br>

-   Discuss folders and files created automatically

<br>

-   Check the contents of file `.gitignore`
:::

::: notes
(NEXT)

(NEXT)

(NEXT)

Folders try to "mirror" the structure of an R package.

Try to understand what all of them are for.

Consider which ones you may need, and which ones you will want to delete.

`.gitignore` files in subfolders are intended to "create the folder structure"

`.Rprofile` only runs a script (we will see later what and why)

`renv.lock` is the "R environment" file (we will see later)

(NEXT)

.gitignore file will tell "git" that certain files must be "ignored"
:::

## Add collaborators

<br>

::: nonincremental
1.  Click on tab "Settings"

2.  Click on "Collaborators"

3.  Click on "Add people"

5.  Click on a collaborator's profile

6.  Click on "Add \<collaborator\> to this repository"
